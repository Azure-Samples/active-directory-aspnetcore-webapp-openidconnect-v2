## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core 2.x Web App application calling The Microsoft Graph.

1. The .Net client ASP.NET Core 2.x Web App application uses the MicroSoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the Microsoft Graph.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial.git
```

or download and exact the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start to run the code.

If you don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below.

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the webApp app (WebApp-GroupClaims)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-GroupClaims`.
   - Leave **Supported account types** on the default setting of **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **Authentication**..
   - In the Redirect URIs section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs.
       - `https://localhost:44321/`
       - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
       - `https://localhost:44321/Account/EndSession`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires
     the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to
     sign-in the user, and call an API.
1. Select **Save**.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **Directory.Read.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the webApp project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` app, in the Azure portal.


### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-GroupClaims` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable ##
1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql conenction string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable end ##

1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.

## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable ##
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.
## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable end ##

1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-GroupClaims project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `WebApp-GroupClaims`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application.
1. In the **Authentication** | page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.

> NOTE: Remember, the To Do list is stored in memory in this TodoListService sample. Azure Web Sites will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and your To Do list will get emptied.
Also, if you increase the instance count of the web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. To Do will, therefore, not be the same on each instance.
