        Add authorization using groups & group claims to an ASP.NET Core Web app thats signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform
    </h1>
<p>
    This sample shows how to build a .NET Core 2.1 MVC Web app that uses OpenID Connect to sign in users. Users can use personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has integrated with Azure Active Directory. It leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware.
