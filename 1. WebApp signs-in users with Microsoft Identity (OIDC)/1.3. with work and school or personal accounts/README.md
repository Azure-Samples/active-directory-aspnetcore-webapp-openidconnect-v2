# Bulid an ASP.NET Core Web app signing-in users with the Microsoft identity platform

> This sample is for Azure AD, not Azure AD B2C. See [active-directory-b2c-dotnetcore-webapp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnetcore-webapp), until we incorporate the B2C variation in the tutorial.

## Scenario

This sample shows how to build a .NET Core 2.2 MVC Web app that uses OpenID Connect to sign in users. Users can use personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has integrated with Azure Active Directory. It leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware.

> This is the first phase of a set of tutorials. Once you understand how to sign-in users in an ASP.NET Core Web App with Open Id Connect, can can learn how to enable your [Web App to call a Web API on behalf of the signed-in user](../../2.%20WebApp%20calls%20Microsoft%20Graph%20on%20behalf%20of%20signed-in%20user)

## How to run this sample

To run this sample:

> Pre-requisites: Install .NET Core 2.2 or later (for example for Windows) by following the instructions at [.NET and C# - Get Started in 10 Minutes](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). In addition to developing on Windows, you can develop on [Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat), [Mac](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos), or [Docker](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#dockercmd).

### Step 1: Register the sample with your Azure AD tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either use PowerShell scripts that **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you and modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files. If you want to use this automation:

  1. On Windows run PowerShell and navigate to the solution's folder
  2. In PowerShell run:

  ```PowerShell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
  ```

  3. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordinly

  ```PowerShell
  .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
  ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

  4. Once you've run the script, be sure to follow the manual steps. Indeed Azure AD PowerShell does not create an app which audience is Work or School + personal accounts, even if this registration is already possible from the Azure portal:
     In the list of pages for the application registration of the application, select **Manifest**
     - search for **signInAudience** and make sure it's set to **AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount**
     - Select **Save**
     
       > Tip: If you register your apps with the scripts, to get directly to the app registration portal page for a give app, you can navigate to the links provided in the [AppCreationScripts\createdApps.html](AppCreationScripts\createdApps.html). This file is generated by the scripts during the app registration and configuration.
     
  4. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start. That's it!

- or, if you don't want to use automation, follow the steps below:

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select `Directory + Subscription` at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and switch your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.   
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box.
   - For the *Redirect URI*, enter the base URL for the sample. By default, this sample uses `https://localhost:44321/`.
   - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **Authentication**.
   - In the **Redirect URIs**, add a redirect URL of type Web and valued  `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to sign-in the user.
   - Select **Save**.

> Note that unless the Web App calls a Web API no certificate or secret is needed.

### Step 2: Download/ Clone this sample code or build the application using a template

This sample was created from the dotnet core 2.2 [dotnet new mvc](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new?tabs=netcore2x) template with `SingleOrg` authentication, and then tweaked to let it support tokens for the Azure AD V2 endpoint. You can clone/download this repository or create the sample from the command line:

#### Option 1: Download/ clone this sample

You can clone this sample from your shell or command line:

```Sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial webapp
cd webapp
cd "1. WebApp signs-in users with Microsoft Identity (OIDC)\1.3. with work and school or personal accounts"
  ```

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

In the **appsettings.json** file:
  
- replace the `ClientID` value with the *Application ID* from the application you registered in Application Registration portal on *Step 1*.
- replace the `TenantId` value with `"common"`

#### Option 2: Create the sample from the command line

1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:

    ```Sh
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id common
    ```

    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal.

1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.
1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**). It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token
1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)
1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:

   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

   ```CSharp
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    ```

   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:

     ```CSharp
         services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                 .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
     ```

     by this line:

     ```CSharp
            services.AddAzureAdV2Authentication(Configuration);
     ```

     This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform (fomerly Azure AD v2.0) endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.

    1. Change the `Properties\launchSettings.json` file to ensure that you start your web app from <https://localhost:44321> as registered. For this:
    - update the `sslPort` of the `iisSettings` section to be `44321`
    - in the `applicationUrl` property of use `https://localhost:44321`

### Step 3: Run the sample

1. Build the solution and run it.

2. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. Accept the IIS Express SSL certificate if needed. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Azure AD v2 endpoint. Sign in with your personal account or with work or school account.

## Optional: Restrict sign-in access to your application

By default, when you use the dotnet core template with `SingleOrg` authentication option and follow the instructions in this guide to configure the application to use the Microsoft identity platform (fomerly Azure AD v2.0) endpoint, both personal accounts - like outlook.com, live.com, and others - as well as Work or school accounts from any organizations that are integrated with Azure AD can sign in to your application. These multi-tenant apps are typically used on SaaS applications.

It's possible to restric the audience for your application by changing the audience in your application registration.

Note that, using the same application resgistration you've done, you can also restrict the accounts types that can sign in to your application, by using one of these options:

### Option 1: Restrict access to only Work and School accounts

Open **appsettings.json** and replace the line containing the `TenantId` value with `organizations`:

```json
"TenantId": "organizations",
```

You can also learn from the [1. WebApp signs-in users with Microsoft Identity (OIDC) / in any org/](../1.2.%20in%20any%20org) step of the tutorial if you are interested in this use case. You will also learn how to restrict to this multi-tenant application to specific tenants.

### Option 2: Restrict access to only Microsoft personal accounts

Open **appsettings.json** and replace the line containing the `TenantId` value with `consumers`:

```json
"TenantId": "consumers",
```

### Option 3: Restrict access to a single organization (single-tenant)

You can restrict sign-in access for your application to only user accounts that are in a single Azure AD tenant - including *guest accounts* of that tenant. This scenario is a common for *line-of-business applications*:

1. Open **appsettings.json** and replace the line containing the `TenantId` value with the domain of your tenant, for example, *contoso.onmicrosoft.com* or the guid for the Tenant ID:

   ```json
   "TenantId": "[Enter the domain of your tenant, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com or the Tenant Id]",
   ```

You can also learn from the [1. WebApp signs-in users with Microsoft Identity (OIDC) / in my org/](../1.1.%20in%20my%20org) step of the tutorial if you are interested in this use case

## Toubleshooting

### known issue on iOS 12

ASP.NET core applications create session cookies that represent the identity of the caller. Some Safari users using iOS 12 had issues which are described in [ASP.NET Core #4467](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4647) and the Web kit bugs database [Bug 188165 - iOS 12 Safari breaks ASP.NET Core 2.1 OIDC authentication](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165). 

If your web site needs to be accessed from users using iOS 12, you probably want to disable the SameSite protection, but also ensure that state changes are protected with CSRF anti-forgery mecanism. See the how to fix section of [Microsoft Security Advisory: iOS12 breaks social, WSFed and OIDC logins #4647](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4647)

## About The code

This sample shows how to use the OpenID Connect ASP.NET Core middleware to sign in users from a single Azure AD tenant. The middleware is initialized in the `Startup.cs` file by passing it the Client ID of the app, and the URL of the Azure AD tenant where the app is registered. These values are  read from the `appsettings.json` file. The middleware takes care of:

- Downloading the Azure AD metadata, finding the signing keys, and finding the issuer name for the tenant.
- Processing OpenID Connect sign-in responses by validating the signature and issuer in an incoming JWT, extracting the user's claims, and putting the claims in `ClaimsPrincipal.Current`.
- Integrating with the session cookie ASP.NET Core middleware to establish a session for the user.

You can trigger the middleware to send an OpenID Connect sign-in request by decorating a class or method with the `[Authorize]` attribute or by issuing a challenge (see the `AccountController.cs` file):

The middleware in this project is created as a part of the open-source [ASP.NET Core Security](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnetcore) project.

These steps are encapsulated in the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](..\..\Microsoft.Identity.Web) project, and in particular in the [StartupHelper.cs](..\..\Microsoft.Identity.Web\StartupHelper.cs) file
