    "FreeText": "\n### Creating the client web app (TodoListClient)\n\n#### Step 1: the sample from the command line\n\n1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:\n\n    ```Sh\n    md TodoListClient\n    cd TodoListClient\n    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id <yourTenantId>\n    ```\n\n    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal and *`<yourTenantId>`* with the *Directory (tenant) ID* where you created your application.\n\n#### Step 2: Modify the generated code\n\n1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.\n1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**). It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token.\n1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)\n\n1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:\n\n   * at the top of the file, add the following using directive were added:\n\n     ```CSharp\n      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;\n      ```\n\n   * in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:\n\n     ```CSharp\n      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\n              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind(\"AzureAd\", options));\n     ```\n\n     with these lines:\n\n     ```CSharp\n     services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)\n             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(\n               Configuration.GetSection(\"TodoList:TodoListScopes\").Get<string>().Split(\" \", System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries))\n             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();\n     ```\n\n    This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.\n\n1. Change the `Properties\\launchSettings.json` file to ensure that you start your web app from <https://localhost:44321> as registered. For this:\n     * update the `sslPort` of the `iisSettings` section to be `44321`\n     * in the `applicationUrl` property of use `https://localhost:44321`\n     * Then add the following code to inject the ToDoList service implementation in the client\n\n   ```CSharp\n     // Add APIs\n     services.AddTodoListService(Configuration);\n   ```\n\n1. Open the `appsettings.json` file and copy the keys from the sample's corresponding file under the `AzureAd` and `TodoList` sections.\n\n#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and add the controller and views\n\n1. In the TodoListClient project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (TodoListService\\Controllers\\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.\n1. Copy the files `TodoListService` and `TodoListService.cs` in the **TodoListClient\\Services** folder provided in this sample to your project.\n1. Copy the contents of **TodoListClient\\views\\ToDo** folder to the views folder of your project.\n1. Modify the `Views\\Shared\\_Layout.cshtml` to add a link to the **ToDolist** controller. Check the `Views\\Shared\\_Layout.cshtml` in the sample for reference.\n1. Add a section name **TodoList** in the appsettings.json file and add the keys `TodoListScope`, `TodoListBaseAddress`.\n1. Update the `configureServices` method in `startup.cs` to add the MSAL library and a token cache.\n\n    ```CSharp\n     services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\n             .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration)\n             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { Configuration[\"TodoList:TodoListScopes\"] })\n             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();\n    ```\n\n1. Update the `Configure` method to include **app.UseAuthentication();** before **app.UseAuthorization();**  \n\n  ```Csharp\n     app.UseAuthentication();\n     app.AddAuthorization();\n  ```\n\n### Creating the Web API project (TodoListService)\n\nThe code for the TodoListService was created in the following way:\n\n#### Step 1: Create the web api using the ASP.NET Core templates\n\n```Text\nmd TodoListService\ncd TodoListService\ndotnet new webapi -au=SingleOrg\n```\n\n1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.\n\n#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and modify the controller\n\nIn the TodoListService project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListService\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n\n### Modify the Startup.cs file to validate bearer access tokens received by the Web API\n\n1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**).\n1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)\nUpdate `Startup.cs` file :\n\n *Add the following two using statements\n\n```CSharp\nusing Microsoft.Identity.Web;\nusing Microsoft.Identity.Web.Client.TokenCacheProviders;\n```\n\n *In the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the following code:\n\n  ```CSharp\n  services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)\n          .AddAzureADBearer(options => Configuration.Bind(\"AzureAd\", options));\n   ```\n\n  with\n\n  ```Csharp\n    services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);\n  ```\n\n *Add the method **app.UseAuthentication()** before **app.UseAuthorization()** in the `Configure` method\n\n  ```Csharp\n     app.UseAuthentication();\n     app.UseAuthorization();\n  ```\n\n### Create the TodoListController.cs file\n\n1. Add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (TodoListService\\Controllers\\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.\n"

  "ReadmeAboutTheCode": {
    "FreeText": "\n1. In the `TodoListService` project, first the package `Microsoft.Identity.Web`is added from NuGet.\n\n1. Starting with the **Startup.cs** file :\n\n   * at the top of the file, the following two using directives were added:\n\n     ```CSharp\n      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;\n      ```\n\n   * in the `ConfigureServices` method, the following code was added, replacing any existing `AddAuthentication()` code:\n\n    ```CSharp\n            services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);\n    ```\n\n   * `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication()` protects the Web API by validating Access tokens sent tho this API. Check out [Protected web API: Code configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-protected-web-api-app-configuration) which explains the inner workings of this method in more detail.\n\n   * Then in the controllers `TodoListController.cs`, the `[Authorize]` added on top of the class to protect this route.\n   * Further in the controller, the `RequiredScope` is used to list the scopes ([Delegated permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent)), that the user should consent for, before the method can be called.  \n   * The delegated permissions are checked inside `TodoListService\\Controllers\\ToDoListController.cs` in the following way:\n\n```CSharp\n  [HttpGet]\n  [RequiredScope(new string[] { \"ToDoList.Read\", \"ToDoList.Write\" })\n\n  public IEnumerable<Todo> Get()\n  {\n      string owner = User.Identity.Name;\n      return TodoStore.Values.Where(x => x.Owner == owner);\n  }\n```\n\nThe code above demonstrates that to be able to reach a GET REST operation, the access token should contain AT LEAST ONE of the scopes listed inside parameter of [RequiredScope attribute](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Identity.Web/Policy/RequiredScopeAttribute.cs)\n\n``` CSharp\n  [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]\n  [RequiredScope(\"ToDoList.Write\")]\n  public void Delete(int id)\n  {\n    TodoStore.Remove(id);\n  }\n```\n\nThe above code demonstrates that to be able to execute the DELETE REST operation, the access token MUST contain the `ToDoList.Write` scope. Note that the called is not allowed to access this operation with just `ToDoList.Read` scope only.\n\n### Initial scopes\n\nClient [appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/master/4-WebApp-your-API/4-1-MyOrg/Client/appsettings.json) file contains `ToDoListScopes` key that is used in [startup.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/2607df1338a9f7c06fe228c87644b8b456ca708b/4-WebApp-your-API/4-1-MyOrg/Client/Startup.cs#L46) to specify which initial scopes should be requested from Web API when refreshing the token:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)\n                    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(Configuration.GetSection(\"TodoList:TodoListScopes\").Get<string>().Split(\" \", System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries))\n                    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();\n```\n\n"
