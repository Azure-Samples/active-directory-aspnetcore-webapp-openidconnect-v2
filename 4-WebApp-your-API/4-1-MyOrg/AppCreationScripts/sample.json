  "ReadmeAboutTheCode": {
    "FreeText": "\n### Creating the client web app (TodoListClient)\n\n#### Step 1: Create the sample from the command line\n\n1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:\n\n    ```Sh\n    md TodoListClient\n    cd TodoListClient\n    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id <yourTenantId>\n    ```\n\n    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal and *`<yourTenantId>`* with the *Directory (tenant) ID* where you created your application.\n\n#### Step 2: Modified the generated code\n\n1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.\n1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**). It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token.\n1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)\n\n1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:\n\n   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:\n\n     ```CSharp\n      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;\n      ```\n\n   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:\n\n     ```CSharp\n      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\n              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind(\"AzureAd\", options));\n     ```\n\n     with these lines:\n\n     ```CSharp\n     services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)\n             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { Configuration[\"TodoList:TodoListScope\"] })\n             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();\n     ```\n\n     This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.\n\n    1. Change the `Properties\\launchSettings.json` file to ensure that you start your web app from <https://localhost:44321> as registered. For this:\n    - update the `sslPort` of the `iisSettings` section to be `44321`\n    - in the `applicationUrl` property of use `https://localhost:44321`\n    - Then add the following code to inject the ToDoList service implementation in the client\n\n   ```CSharp\n     // Add APIs\n     services.AddTodoListService(Configuration);\n   ```\n\n1. Open the `appsettings.json` file and copy the keys from the sample's corresponding file under the `AzureAd` and `TodoList` sections.\n\n#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and add the controller and views\n\n1. In the TodoListClient project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (TodoListService\\Controllers\\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.\n1. Copy the files `TodoListService` and `TodoListService.cs` in the **TodoListClient\\Services** folder provided in this sample to your project.\n1. Copy the contents of **TodoListClient\\views\\ToDo** folder to the views folder of your project.\n1. Modify the `Views\\Shared\\_Layout.cshtml` to add a link to the ***ToDolist* controller. Check the `Views\\Shared\\_Layout.cshtml` in the sample for reference.\n1. Add a section name **TodoList** in the appsettings.json file and add the keys `TodoListScope`, `TodoListBaseAddress`.\n1. Update the `configureServices` method in `startup.cs` to add the MSAL library and a token cache.\n\n    ```CSharp\n     services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\n             .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration)\n             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { Configuration[\"TodoList:TodoListScope\"] })\n             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();\n    ```\n\n1. Update the `Configure` method to include **app.UseAuthentication();** before **app.UseMvc();**  \n\n  ```Csharp\n     app.UseAuthentication();\n     app.UseMvc();\n  ```\n\n### Creating the Web API project (TodoListService)\n\nThe code for the TodoListService was created in the following way:\n\n#### Step 1: Create the web api using the ASP.NET Core templates\n\n```Text\nmd TodoListService\ncd TodoListService\ndotnet new webapi -au=SingleOrg\n```\n\n1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.\n\n#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and modify the controller\n\nIn the TodoListService project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListService\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n\n### Modify the Startup.cs file to validate bearer access tokens received by the Web API\n\n1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**).\n1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)\nUpdate `Startup.cs` file :\n\n- Add the following two using statements\n\n```CSharp\nusing Microsoft.Identity.Web;\nusing Microsoft.Identity.Web.Client.TokenCacheProviders;\n```\n\n- In the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the following code:\n\n  ```CSharp\n  services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)\n          .AddAzureADBearer(options => Configuration.Bind(\"AzureAd\", options));\n   ```\n\n  with\n\n  ```Csharp\n    services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);\n  ```\n\n- Add the method **app.UseAuthentication()** before **app.UseMvc()** in the `Configure` method\n\n  ```Csharp\n     app.UseAuthentication();\n     app.UseMvc();\n  ```\n\n  `AddMicrosoftWebApi` does the following:\n  - add the **Jwt**BearerAuthenticationScheme (Note the replacement of **BearerAuthenticationScheme** by **Jwt**BearerAuthenticationScheme)\n  - set the authority to be the Microsoft identity platform identity\n  - sets the audiences to validate\n  - register an issuer validator that accepts issuers to be in the Microsoft identity platform clouds.\n\nThe implementations of these classes are in the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` library (and folder), and they are designed to be reusable in your applications (Web apps and Web apis). You are encouraged to browse the code in the library to understand the changes in detail.\n\n### Create the TodoListController.cs file\n\n1. Add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\\Models\\TodoItem.cs in this file.\n1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (\\TodoListService\\Controllers\\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.\n"

To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:\n\n- create an Azure Web Site\n- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and\n- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.\n\n### Create and publish the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` to an Azure Web Site\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).\n1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.\n1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.\n1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.\n1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.\n1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.\n1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.\n1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.\n1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.\n1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.\n1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.\n\n### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`\n\n1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).\nIn the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.\n1. In the resultant screen, select the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` application.\n1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.\n1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.\n\n### Update the `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` to call the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` Running in Azure Web Sites\n\n1. In Visual Studio, go to the `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` project.\n2. Open `Client\\appsettings.json`.  Only one change is needed - update the `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` key value to be the address of the website you published,\n   for example, [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net).\n3. Run the client! If you are trying multiple different client types (for example, .Net, Windows Store, Android, iOS) you can have them all call this one published web API.\n\n### Create and publish the `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` to an Azure Web Site\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).\n1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.\n1.
