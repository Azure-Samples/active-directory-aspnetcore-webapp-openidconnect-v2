<details>
 <summary>Expand the section</summary>

This project has two WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

 *create an Azure Web Site
 *publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
 *update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.
1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.
1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.

### Update the `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` to call the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` Running in Azure Web Sites

1. In Visual Studio, go to the `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` project.
2. Open `Client\appsettings.json`.  Only one change is needed - update the `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` key value to be the address of the website you published,
   for example, [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net).
3. Run the client! If you are trying multiple different client types (for example, .Net, Windows Store, Android, iOS) you can have them all call this one published web API.

> NOTE: Remember, the To Do list is stored in memory in this TodoListService sample. Azure Web Sites will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and your To Do list will get emptied.
Also, if you increase the instance count of the web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. To Do will, therefore, not be the same on each instance.
