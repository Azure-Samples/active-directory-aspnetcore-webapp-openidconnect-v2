 Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:44321` and sign-in using the link on top-right. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. Sign in using an user account in that tenant.

1. Click on `TodoList`, you can click on `Create New` link. It will redirect to create task screen where you can add a new task and assign it to any user from the list.
1. The `TodoList` screen also displays tasks that are assigned to and created by signed-in user. The user can edit and delete the created tasks but can only view the assigned tasks.

> NOTE: Remember, the TodoList is stored in memory in this `TodoListService` app. Each time you run the projects, your TodoList will get emptied.
