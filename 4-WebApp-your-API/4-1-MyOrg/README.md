[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)

## Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core Web App calling a ASP.NET Core Web API that is secured using Azure AD.

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core Web App uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
2. The [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the ASP.NET Core Web API protected by **Azure AD**.
![Topology](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2.git

cd "4-WebApp-your-API\4-1-Your-API"
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the service app (TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app (TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `TodoListService\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` app copied from the Azure portal.

### Register the client app (TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44321/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Front-channel logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Access 'TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi'** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app (TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `Client\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `TodoListClient-aspnetcore-webapi` copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `TodoListScope` and replace the existing value with Scope.
1. Find the key `TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the existing value with the base address of `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` (by default `https://localhost:44351`).

## Running the sample

> For Visual Studio Users
>
> Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

Run the sample using a command line interface such as VS Code integrated terminal

```console
cd TodoListService
dotnet run
```

```console
cd Client
dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:44321` and sign-in using the link on top-right.
1. Click on `TodoList`, you can click on `Create New` link. It will redirect to create task screen where you can add a new task and assign it to any user from the list.
1. The `TodoList` screen also displays tasks that are assigned to and created by signed-in user. The user can edit and delete the created tasks but can only view the assigned tasks.

> NOTE: Remember, the TodoList is stored in memory in this `TodoListService` app. Each time you run the projects, your TodoList will get emptied.

## Variation: web app using client certificates

Follow [README-use-certificate.md](README-use-certificate.md) to know how to use this option.

## How was the code created

### Creating the client web app (TodoListClient)

#### Step 1: Create the sample from the command line

1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:

    ```Sh
    md TodoListClient
    cd TodoListClient
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id <yourTenantId>
    ```

    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal and *`<yourTenantId>`* with the *Directory (tenant) ID* where you created your application.

#### Step 2: Modified the generated code

1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.
1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**). It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token.
1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)

1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:

   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

     ```CSharp
      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
      ```

   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:

     ```CSharp
      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
     ```

     with these lines:

     ```CSharp
     services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { Configuration["TodoList:TodoListScope"] })
             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
     ```

     This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.

    1. Change the `Properties\launchSettings.json` file to ensure that you start your web app from <https://localhost:44321> as registered. For this:
    - update the `sslPort` of the `iisSettings` section to be `44321`
    - in the `applicationUrl` property of use `https://localhost:44321`
    - Then add the following code to inject the ToDoList service implementation in the client

   ```CSharp
     // Add APIs
     services.AddTodoListService(Configuration);
   ```

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file and copy the keys from the sample's corresponding file under the `AzureAd` and `TodoList` sections.

#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and add the controller and views

1. In the TodoListClient project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\Models\TodoItem.cs in this file.
1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (TodoListService\Controllers\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.
1. Copy the files `TodoListService` and `TodoListService.cs` in the **TodoListClient\Services** folder provided in this sample to your project .
1. Copy the contents of **TodoListClient\views\ToDo** folder to the views folder of your project.
1. Modify the `Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml` to add a link to the ***ToDolist* controller. Check the `Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml` in the sample for reference.
1. Add a section name **TodoList** in the appsettings.json file and add the keys `TodoListScope`, `TodoListBaseAddress`.
1. Update the `configureServices` method in `startup.cs` to add the MSAL library and a token cache.

    ```CSharp
     services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
             .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration)
             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { Configuration["TodoList:TodoListScope"] })
             .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
    ```

1. Update the `Configure` method to include **app.UseAuthentication();** before **app.UseMvc();**  

  ```Csharp
     app.UseAuthentication();
     app.UseMvc();
  ```

### Creating the Web API project (TodoListService)

The code for the TodoListService was created in the following way:

#### Step 1: Create the web api using the ASP.NET Core templates

```Text
md TodoListService
cd TodoListService
dotnet new webapi -au=SingleOrg
```

1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.

#### Add a model (TodoListItem) and modify the controller

In the TodoListService project, add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListService\Models\TodoItem.cs in this file.

### Modify the Startup.cs file to validate bearer access tokens received by the Web API

1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**).
1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)
Update `Startup.cs` file :

- Add the following two using statements

```CSharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web.Client.TokenCacheProviders;
```

- In the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the following code:

  ```CSharp
  services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)
          .AddAzureADBearer(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
   ```

  with

  ```Csharp
    services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);
  ```

- Add the method **app.UseAuthentication()** before **app.UseMvc()** in the `Configure` method

  ```Csharp
     app.UseAuthentication();
     app.UseMvc();
  ```

  `AddMicrosoftWebApi` does the following:
  - add the **Jwt**BearerAuthenticationScheme (Note the replacement of **BearerAuthenticationScheme** by **Jwt**BearerAuthenticationScheme)
  - set the authority to be the Microsoft identity platform identity
  - sets the audiences to validate
  - register an issuer validator that accepts issuers to be in the Microsoft identity platform clouds.

The implementations of these classes are in the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` library (and folder), and they are designed to be reusable in your applications (Web apps and Web apis). You are encouraged to browse the code in the library to understand the changes in detail.

### Create the TodoListController.cs file

1. Add a folder named `Models` and then create a new  file named `TodoItem.cs`. Copy the contents of the TodoListClient\Models\TodoItem.cs in this file.
1. Create a new Controller named `TodoListController` and copy and paste the code from the sample (\TodoListService\Controllers\TodoListController.cs) to this controller.
## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has two WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.
1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.
1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
