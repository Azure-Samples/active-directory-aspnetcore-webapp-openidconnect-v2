## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This tutorial has one WebApp and some chapters have a Web API project. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need to perform these steps for **each** project:

- create an Azure Web Site with a unique name
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

### If your project uses **SQL Server**, please follow these steps

1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql connection string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.

### Update the redirect URLs

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2` application.
1. In the **Authentication** tab:
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and add the following redirect URIs.
       - `https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net`
       - `https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net/signout-oidc`
1. In the **Branding** tab:
    - Update the **Home page URL** to the address of your app service, for example `https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
    - Save the configuration.
1. If your application calls a web api, make sure to apply the necessary changes on the project `appsettings.json`, so it calls the published API URL instead of `localhost`.

### Publishing the sample

1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2 project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-code-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

## Key Vault and Managed Service Identity (MSI)

Secure key management is essential to protect data in the cloud. Use [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/key-vault/) to encrypt keys and small secrets like passwords that use keys stored in hardware security modules (HSMs).

You can follow [this sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-msi-keyvault-dotnet) as a guide on how to use Azure KeyVault from App Service with Managed Service Identity (MSI).
