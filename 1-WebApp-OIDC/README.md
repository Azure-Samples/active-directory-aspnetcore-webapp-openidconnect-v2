   1. If you are a Line of Business (LOB) developer, you'd probably want to only [sign-in users in your organization](./1-1-MyOrg/README.md) with their work or school accounts.
   1. If you are an ISV building a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application, you'd want to [sign-in users in any Azure AD tenant](./1-2-AnyOrg/README-1-1-to-1-2.md).
