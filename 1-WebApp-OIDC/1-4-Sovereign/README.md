# Build an ASP.NET Core Web app signing-in users in sovereign clouds with the Microsoft identity platform

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)

## Scenario

This sample shows how to build a .NET Core 2.2 MVC Web app that uses OpenID Connect to sign in users. Users can only sign in with their 'work and school' accounts in their organization **belonging to national or sovereign clouds**. This sample use  US Government cloud scenario. It leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware.

![Sign in with Azure AD](ReadmeFiles/sign-in.png)

National clouds (aka Sovereign clouds) are physically isolated instances of Azure. These regions of Azure are designed to make sure that data residency, sovereignty, and compliance requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.

In addition to the public cloud​, Azure Active Directory is deployed in the following National clouds:  

- Azure US Government
- Azure China 21Vianet
- Azure Germany

Note that enabling your application for sovereign clouds requires you to:

- register your application in a specific portal, depending on the cloud
- use a specific authority, depending on the cloud in the config file for your application
- in case you want to call the graph, this requires a specific Graph endpoint URL, depending on the cloud.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample:

> Pre-requisites: Install .NET Core 2.2 or later (for example for Windows) by following the instructions at [.NET and C# - Get Started in 10 Minutes](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). In addition to developing on Windows, you can develop on [Linux](https://ww w.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat), [Mac](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos), or [Docker](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#dockercmd).


### Step 1: Download/Clone this sample code 
This sample was created from the dotnet core 2.2 [dotnet new mvc](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new?tabs=netcore2x) template with `SingleOrg` authentication, and then tweaked to let it support tokens for the Microsoft identity platform endpoint.

You can clone this sample from your shell or command line:

  ```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial webapp
cd webapp
cd "1-WebApp-OIDC\1-4-Sovereign"
  ```

> Given that the name of the sample is very long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure AD tenant

1. Sign in to the [US Government Azure portal](https://portal.azure.us)

   > For registering your app in other National Clouds go to [App Registration endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud#app-registration-endpoints) of the National Cloud of your choice using either a work or school account.
   >
   > Note: Azure Germany doesn't support **App registrations (Preview)* experience.

2. Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications
      - If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select profile button at the top-right corner in the menu on top of the page and select `Switch Directory`.
      - On `Directory + Subscription` switch your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only *(name of your org)***.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box.
   - For the *Redirect URI*, enter the base URL for the sample. By default, this sample uses `https://localhost:44321/`.
   - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Still in the **Overview** page, find the **Directory (tenant) ID** value and record it for later.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **Authentication**.
   - In the **Redirect URIs**, add a redirect URL of type Web and valued  `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to sign in the user.
   - Select **Save**.

> Note that unless the Web App calls a Web API no certificate or secret is needed.

### Step 3: Configure your App

#### Option 1:  In the **appsettings.json** file:
  
  - replace the `Instance` value with the relevant authority value of the US Government cloud that is `https://login.microsoftonline.us`
      - For other National Clouds go to [List of authority of National Clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints)
  -  replace the `ClientID` value with the *Application ID* from the application you registered in Application Registration portal on *Step 2*.
  - replace the `TenantId` value with the *Tenant ID* where you registered your Application on *Step 2*.

#### Option 2: Create and configure sample from the command line

1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:

    ```Sh
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id <yourTenantId>
    ```

    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal and *`<yourTenantId>`* with the *Directory (tenant) ID* where you created your application.

1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.
1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web.csproj` project, which is located at the root of this sample repo, to your solution (**Add Existing Project ...**). It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token
1. Add a reference from your newly generated project to `Microsoft.Identity.Web` (right click on the **Dependencies** node under your new project, and choose **Add Reference ...**, and then in the projects tab find the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` project)
1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:

   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

   ```CSharp
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    ```

   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:

     ```CSharp
         services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                 .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
     ```

     by this line:

     ```CSharp
            services.AddAzureAdV2Authentication(Configuration);
     ```

     This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.

    1. Change the `Properties\launchSettings.json` file to ensure that you start your web app from <https://localhost:44321> as registered. For this:
    - update the `sslPort` of the `iisSettings` section to be `44321`
    - in the `applicationUrl` property of use `https://localhost:44321`

### Step 3: Run the sample

1. Build the solution and run it.

2. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. Accept the IIS Express SSL certificate if needed. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. Sign in with your personal account or with work or school account.

## Troubleshooting

### known issue on iOS 12

ASP.NET core applications create session cookies that represent the identity of the caller. Some Safari users using iOS 12 had issues, which are described in [ASP.NET Core #4467](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4647) and the Web kit bugs database [Bug 188165 - iOS 12 Safari breaks ASP.NET Core 2.1 OIDC authentication](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165). 

If your web site needs to be accessed from users using iOS 12, you probably want to disable the SameSite protection, but also ensure that state changes are protected with CSRF anti-forgery mechanism. See the how to fix section of [Microsoft Security Advisory: iOS12 breaks social, WSFed, and OIDC logins #4647](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4647)

## About The code

This sample shows how to use the OpenID Connect ASP.NET Core middleware to sign in users from a single Azure AD tenant. The middleware is initialized in the `Startup.cs` file by passing it the Client ID of the app, and the URL of the Azure AD tenant where the app is registered. These values are  read from the `appsettings.json` file. The middleware takes care of:

- Downloading the Azure AD metadata, finding the signing keys, and finding the issuer name for the tenant.
- Processing OpenID Connect sign-in responses by validating the signature and issuer in an incoming JWT, extracting the user's claims, and putting the claims in `ClaimsPrincipal.Current`.
- Integrating with the session cookie ASP.NET Core middleware to establish a session for the user.

You can trigger the middleware to send an OpenID Connect sign-in request by decorating a class or method with the `[Authorize]` attribute or by issuing a challenge (see the [AccountController.cs](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Azure/AzureAD/Authentication.AzureAD.UI/src/Areas/AzureAD/Controllers/AccountController.cs) file, which is part of ASP.NET Core):


The middleware in this project is created as a part of the open-source [ASP.NET Core Security](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnetcore) project.

These steps are encapsulated in the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](..\..\Microsoft.Identity.Web) project, and in particular in the [StartupHelper.cs](..\..\Microsoft.Identity.Web\StartupHelper.cs) file
