# Add authorization using groups & group claims to an ASP.NET Core Web app that signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample shows how a .NET Core 2.2 MVC Web app that uses [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code) to sign in users. It also obtains the security groups the signed-in user is assigned to as a claim in their token. Security groups are a popular means to implement authorization.

Authorization in Azure AD can also be done with Application Roles, as shown in [WebApp-RoleClaims](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-1-Roles/README-incremental-instructions.md). Azure AD Groups and Application Roles are by no means mutually exclusive - they can be used in tandem to provide even finer grained access control.

## Scenario

This sample first leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware to sign in the user. On the home page it displays the various `claims` that the user's [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) contained. The ID token is used by the asp.net security middleware to build the [ClaimsPrincipal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal), which is accessible via **HttpContext.User** property.

![Sign in with the Microsoft identity platform](ReadmeFiles/sign-in.png)

> This is the fifth chapter of our [tutorial](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/master/README.md). Once you understand how to receive the group memberships in a user's claims, you can also try the sample [Add authorization using app roles & roles claims to an ASP.NET Core Web app thats signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform](../../5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-1-Roles/README-incremental-instructions.md) to learn about how to use the App roles in an app using the Microsoft Identity Platform to authenticate users.

> Pre-requisites:
>
> This guide assumes that you've already went through the previous chapter of the tutorial [Using the Microsoft identity platform to call the Microsoft Graph API from an An ASP.NET Core 2.x Web App](../../2-WebApp-graph-user/2-1-Call-MSGraph). This page shows the incremental change needed to set up group membership claims and retrieve them in your app when a user signs in.

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

Navigate to the `"5-WebApp-AuthZ"` folder

 ```Sh
  cd "5-2-Groups"
  ```

### Step 3: Configure your application to receive the **groups** claims

1. In your application settings page on the Application Registration Portal, click on "Manifest" to open the inline manifest editor.
1. Edit the manifest by locating the "groupMembershipClaims" setting, and setting its value to "SecurityGroup".
1. Save the manifest.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "errorUrl": null,
  "groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup",
  ...
}
```

1. To receive the `groups` claim with the object id of the security groups, make sure that the user accounts you plan to sign-in to this app is assigned to a few security groups in this AAD tenant.

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName/mailNickName' instead of Group Ids, check out the [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory (Public Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#configure-the-azure-ad-application-registration-for-group-attributes) feature.

### Step 4: Run the sample

1. Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

1. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. Sign in with a work or school account from the tenant where you created this app.	
1. On the home page, the app lists the various claims it obtained from your ID token. You'd notice one more claims named `groups`. If **Overage** occurred, then you'd see a different claim by the name `_claim_names`. The **Overage** scenario is discussed in detail below.
1. On the top menu, click on the signed-in user's name **user@domain.com**, you should now see all kind of information about yourself including your picture. Beneath that, a list of all the security groups that the signed-in user is assigned to are listed as well. All of this was obtained by making calls to Microsoft Graph. This list is useful, if an **Overage** occurs with this signed-in user. The **overage** scenario is discussed later in this article.

### Processing Groups claim in tokens, including handling **overage**

#### The `groups` claim

The object id of the security groups the signed in user is member of is returned in the `groups` claim of the token.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "groups": [
    "0bbe91cc-b69e-414d-85a6-a043d6752215",
    "48931dac-3736-45e7-83e8-015e6dfd6f7c",]
  ...
}
```

#### Groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens**), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the groups claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
    "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
   "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Graph Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
    }
  ...
}
```

> An Identity Office Hours session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and how to handle the overage claim. Watch the video [Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VUPixLSiM)

> You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development.

##### Order of processing the overage claim

1. Check for the claim `_claim_names` with one of the values being `groups`. This indicates overage.

1. If found, make a call to the endpoint specified in `_claim_sources` to fetch user’s groups.

1. If none found, look into the `groups`  claim for user’s groups.

> When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [Directory.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberObjects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-getmemberobjects?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to execute successfully.

- Developers who wish to gain good familiarity of programming for Microsoft Graph are advised to go through the [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A) recorded session.

#### When using the implicit_grant flow to authenticate

In case, you are authenticating using the [implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow), the **overage** indication and limits are different than the apps using other flows.

1. A claim named `hasgroups` with a value of true will be present in the token instead of the `groups` claim .
1. The maximum number of groups provided in the `groups` claim is limited to 6. This is done to prevent  the URI fragment beyond the URL length limits.

### Support in ASP.NET Core middleware libraries

The asp.net middleware supports roles populated from claims by specifying the claim in the `RoleClaimType` property of `TokenValidationParameters`.
Since the `groups` claim contains the object ids of the security groups than actual names, you'd use the group id's instead of group names. See [Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2) for more info.

```CSharp

// Startup.cs
public static IServiceCollection AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, X509Certificate2 tokenDecryptionCertificate = null)
{
        // [removed for] brevity

            // The following lines code instruct the asp.net core middleware to use the data in the "groups" claim in the Authorize attribute and User.IsInrole()
            // See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2 for more info.
            services.Configure<OpenIdConnectOptions>(AzureADDefaults.OpenIdScheme, options =>
            {
                // Use the groups claim for populating roles
                options.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "groups";
            });
        // [removed for] brevity
}

// In code..(Controllers & elsewhere)
[Authorize(Roles = “Group-object-id")] // In controllers
// or
User.IsInRole("Group-object-id"); // In methods

```

1. HomeController.cs
    1. Passes the **HttpContext.User** (the signed-in user) to the view.
1. UserProfileController.cs
    1. Uses the **IMSGraphService** methods to fetch the signed-in user's group memberships.
1 IMSGraphService.cs, MSGraphService.cs and UserGroupsAndDirectoryRoles.cs
    1. Uses the [Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) to carry out various operations with [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com).
1. Home\Index.cshtml
    1. This has some code to print the current user's claims
1. UserProfile\Index.cshtml
    1. Has some client code that prints the signed-in user's information obtained from the [/me](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0), [/me/photo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profilephoto-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [/memberOf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0) endpoints.
1. Startup.cs

     ```CSharp
   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
      ```

   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:

     ```CSharp
      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));

     // by this line:

     //This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.
            services.AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(Configuration)
                    .AddMsal(Configuration, new string[] { "User.Read", "Directory.Read.All" }) // Adds support for the MSAL library with the permissions necessary to retrieve the signed-in user's group info in case of a token overage
                    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches(); // Adds aspnetcore MemoryCache as Token cache provider for MSAL.

        services.AddMSGraphService(Configuration);    // Adds the IMSGraphService as an available service for this app.
     ```

1. if you used the Powershell scripts provided in the [AppCreationScripts](.\AppCreationScripts) folder, then note the extra parameter `-GroupMembershipClaims` in the  `Configure.ps1` script.

     ```PowerShell
       -Oauth2AllowImplicitFlow $true `
       -GroupMembershipClaims "SecurityGroup" `
       -PublicClient $False
     ```
