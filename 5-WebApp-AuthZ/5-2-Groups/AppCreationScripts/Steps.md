## Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core Web App application calling The Microsoft Graph.

1. The client ASP.NET Core Web App application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the Microsoft Graph.

## Scenario

> - Describe the scenario in 3 bullet points (+/-1).
> - Insert a screenshot of the client application.

## Contents

> Give a high-level folder structure of the sample.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: Given that the name of the sample is quiet long, and so are the names of the referenced packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

## Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

Follow the steps below to manually walk through the steps to register and configure the applications in the Azure portal.

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant..


#### Register the webApp app (WebApp-GroupClaims)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-GroupClaims`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44321/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you click the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read**, **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the webApp app (WebApp-GroupClaims) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` app, in the Azure portal.

## Deployment

There is one web project in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the projects to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of the local environment.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-GroupClaims` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Next, select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql conenction string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->

1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->

1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from **source control**, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-GroupClaims project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page URL, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Azure AD app registration for `WebApp-GroupClaims`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application.
1. In the **Authentication** page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will emptied.
In addition, if you increase the instance count of your web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
