# Add authorization using groups & group claims to an ASP.NET Core Web app that signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample shows how a .NET Core MVC Web app that uses [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code) to sign in users also obtains the security groups the signed-in user is assigned to as a claim in their token. Security groups are a popular means to implement authorization.

Authorization in Azure AD can also be done with `Application Roles` as well, as shown in [WebApp-RoleClaims](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-1-Roles/README.md). `Groups` and `Application Roles` in Azure AD are by no means mutually exclusive - they can be used in tandem to provide even finer grained access control.

## Scenario

This sample first leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware to sign in the user. On the home page it displays the various `claims` that the signed-in user's [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) contained. The ID token is used by the asp.net security middleware to build the [ClaimsPrincipal](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal), accessible via **HttpContext.User**.

> An Identity Developer session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and how to handle the overage claim. Watch the video [Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRoc-na27l0)

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your **Azure AD**. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

 > Please make sure to have one or more user accounts in the tenant assigned to a few security groups in your tenant. Please follow the instructions in [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal) to create a few groups and assign users to them if not already done.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: Given that the name of the sample is quite long, and so are the names of the referenced packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid maximum file path length limitations on Windows.

Navigate to the `"5-WebApp-AuthZ"` folder

 ```Sh
  cd 5-WebApp-AuthZ\5-2-Groups
  ```

## Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

Follow the steps below to manually walk through the steps to register and configure the applications in the Azure portal.

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the web app (WebApp-GroupClaims)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-GroupClaims`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44321/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`.
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires
     the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) to be enabled to
     sign-in the user, and call an API.

1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you click the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** and **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly and the **GroupMember.Read.All** requires admin to consent.
   Click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

##### Configure the  web app (WebApp-GroupClaims) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio) to configure the code.
>In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` app, in the Azure portal.

#### Configure your application to receive the **groups** claim

You have two different options available to you on how you can further configure your application to receive the `groups` claim.

1. [Receive **all the groups** that the signed-in user is assigned to in an Azure AD tenant, included nested groups](#configure-your-application-to-receive-all-the-groups-the-signed-in-user-is-assigned-to-included-nested-groups).
1. [Receive the **groups** claim values from a **filtered set of groups** that your application is programmed to work with](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (Not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)).

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName` or `On Premises Group Security Identifier` instead of Group ID, please refer to the document [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#prerequisites-for-using-group-attributes-synchronized-from-active-directory).

##### Configure your application to receive **all the groups** the signed-in user is assigned to, included nested groups

1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Click on the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Security groups` **or** the `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` option. Choosing both negates the effect of `Security Groups` option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [object id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the **groups** claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.
1. If you are exposing a Web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [object id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) issued to the client applications of your API.

##### Configure your application to receive the `groups` claim values from a **filtered set of groups** a user may be assigned to

###### Prerequisites, benefits and limitations of using this option

1. This option is useful when your application is interested in a selected set of groups that a signing-in user may be assigned to and not every security group this user is assigned to in the tenant.  This option also saves your application from running into the [overage](#groups-overage-claim) issue.
1. This feature is not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
1. **Nested group assignments** are not available when this option is utilized.

###### Steps to enable this option in your app

1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Click on the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Groups assigned to the application`.
    1. Choosing additional options like `Security Groups` or `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` will negate the benefits your app derives from choosing to use this option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the object [id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.
1. If you are exposing a Web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) issued to the client applications of your API.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Overview** blade in the left to open the Application overview screen. Select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance `Managed application in ...`). When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the *back* button of your browser.
1. Select the **Users and groups** blade in the left to open the page where you can assign users and groups to your application.
    1. Click on the **Add user** button on the top row.
    1. Select **User and Groups** from the resultant screen.
    1. Choose the groups that you want to assign to this application.
    1. Click **Select** in the bottom to finish selecting the groups.
    1. Click **Assign** to finish the group assignment process.  
    1. Your application will now receive these selected groups in the `groups` claim when a user signing in to your app is a member of  one or more these **assigned** groups.
1. Select the **Properties** blade in the left to open the page that lists the basic properties of your application.Set the **User assignment required?** flag to **Yes**.
   > **Important security tip**
   >
   > When you set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, Azure AD will check that only users assigned to your application in the **Users and groups** blade are able to sign-in to your app. You can assign users directly or by assigning security groups they belong to.

### Configure the web app (WebApp-GroupClaims) to recognize Group IDs

> :warning:
> During **Token Configuration**, if you have chosen any other option except **groupID** (e.g. like **DNSDomain\sAMAccountName**) you should enter the **group name** (for example `contoso.com\Test Group`) instead of the **object ID** below:

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the app key `Groups.GroupAdmin` and replace the existing value with the object ID of the **GroupAdmin** group copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `Groups.GroupMember` and replace the existing value with the object ID of the **GroupMember** group copied from the Azure portal.

## Running the sample

### Run the sample using Visual Studio

> For Visual Studio Users
>
> Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

### Run the sample using a command line interface such as VS Code integrated terminal

#### Step 1. Install .NET Core dependencies

```console
   cd WebApp-GroupClaims
   dotnet restore
```

#### Step 2. Trust development certificates

```console
   dotnet dev-certs https --clean
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Learn more about [HTTPS in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).

#### Step 3. Run the applications

In the console window execute the below command:

```console
    dotnet run
```

1. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you to the Microsoft identity platform. You can sign-in with a *work or school account* from the tenant where you created this app. If admin consent to `GroupMember.Read.All` permission from portal is not done then sign-in with admin for the first time and consent for the permission.
1. If the **Overage** scenario occurs for the signed-in user then all the groups are retrieved from Microsoft Graph and added in a list. The [overage](#groups-overage-claim) scenario is discussed later in this article.
1. On the home page, the app lists the various claims it obtained from your ID token. You'd notice one more claims named `groups`.
1. On the top menu, click on the signed-in user's name **user@domain.com**, you should now see all kind of information about yourself including their picture.

> Did the sample not work for you as expected? Did you encounter issues trying this sample? Then please reach out to us using the [GitHub Issues](../../../../issues) page.

> [Consider taking a moment to share your experience with us.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRz0h_jLR5HNJlvkZAewyoWxUNEFCQ0FSMFlPQTJURkJZMTRZWVJRNkdRMC4u)

### Processing Groups claim in tokens, including handling **overage**

#### The `groups` claim

The object id of the security groups the signed in user is member of is returned in the `groups` claim of the token.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "groups": [
    "0bbe91cc-b69e-414d-85a6-a043d6752215",
    "48931dac-3736-45e7-83e8-015e6dfd6f7c",]
  ...
}
```

### The groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, 6 for Single Page applications**), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the group IDs in the `groups` claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [MS Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
    "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
   "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Graph Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
    }
  ...
}
```

#### Create the overage scenario in this sample for testing

1. You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development. Remember to change the user's **objectId** provided in the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` script.
1. When you run this sample and an overage occurred, then you'd see the  `_claim_names` in the home page after the user signs-in.
1. We strongly advise you use the [group filtering feature](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (if possible) to avoid running into group overages.
1. In case you cannot avoid running into group overage, we suggest you use the following logic to process groups claim in your token.  
    1. Check for the claim `_claim_names` with one of the values being `groups`. This indicates overage.
    1. If found, make a call to the endpoint specified in `_claim_sources` to fetch user’s groups.
    1. If none found, look into the `groups`  claim for user’s groups.

> When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [GroupMember.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberObjects](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-getmemberobjects?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to execute successfully.

> Developers who wish to gain good familiarity of programming for Microsoft Graph are advised to go through the [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A) recorded session.

##### When you are a single page application and using the implicit grant flow to authenticate

In case, you are authenticating using the [implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow), the **overage** indication and limits are different than the apps using other flows.

1. A claim named `hasgroups` with a value of true will be present in the token instead of the `groups` claim .
1. The maximum number of groups provided in the `groups` claim is limited to 6. This is done to prevent  the URI fragment beyond the URL length limits.

## About the code

### Create the sample from the command line

> The following code used an older version of `[Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web) library and would be updated when the library becomes Generally Available.

This project was created using the following command.

1. Run the following command to create a sample from the command line using the `SingleOrg` template:

    ```Sh
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <Enter_the_Application_Id_here> --tenant-id <yourTenantId>
    ```

    > Note: Replace *`Enter_the_Application_Id_here`* with the *Application Id* from the application Id you just registered in the Application Registration Portal and *`<yourTenantId>`* with the *Directory (tenant) ID* where you created your application.

1. Open the generated project (.csproj) in Visual Studio, and save the solution.
1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Web` NuGet package. It's used to simplify signing-in and, in the next tutorial phases, to get a token.
1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and:

   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

     ```CSharp
      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
     ```

The following files have the code that would be of interest to you:

1. HomeController.cs
    1. Passes the **HttpContext.User** (the signed-in user) to the view.
    1. Calls method **GetSessionGroupList** of `GraphHelper.cs` to get groups from session and if groups are returned then pass them to the view.

       ```csharp
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            ViewData["User"] = HttpContext.User;
            var groups = GraphHelper.GetUserGroupsFromSession(HttpContext.Session);
            if (groups?.Count > 0)
            {
                ViewData.Add("groupClaims", groups );
            }
            return View();
        }
       ```

1. Home\Index.cshtml
    1. This has some code to print the current user's claims.

1. Startup.cs

    - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

      ```CSharp
         using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
      ```

    - in the `ConfigureServices` method, the following lines:

     ```CSharp
      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
     ```

    - have been replaced by these lines:

     ```CSharp
      services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
              .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
          options =>
          {
              Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options);
              options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents();
              options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =>
              {
                  var overageGroupClaims = await GraphHelper.GetSignedInUsersGroups(context);
              };
          }, options => { Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options); })
              .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options), initialScopes)
              .AddMicrosoftGraph(Configuration.GetSection("GraphAPI"))
              .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
      ```

    `OnTokenValidated` event calls **GetSignedInUsersGroups** method, that is defined in GraphHelper.cs, to process groups overage claim.
  
    `AddMicrosoftGraph` registers the service for `GraphServiceClient`. The values for BaseUrl and Scopes defined in `GraphAPI` section of **appsettings.json**.

    Following lines of code adds authorization policies that enforce authorization using group values.

    ```csharp
          services.AddAuthorization(options =>
          {
            options.AddPolicy("GroupAdmin",
            policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new GroupPolicyRequirement(Configuration["Groups:GroupAdmin"])));
                options.AddPolicy("GroupMember",
              policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new GroupPolicyRequirement(Configuration["Groups:GroupMember"])));
          });
    ```
  
1. In GraphHelper.cs, **GetSignedInUsersGroups** method checks if incoming token contains *Group Overage* claim then returns the list of groups from Microsoft Graph. First **GetUserGroupsFromSession** method is called to get group values from session if exists. If session does not contain groups claim then it will call **ProcessUserGroupsForOverage** method to retrieve groups.
  
      ```csharp
    public static async Task<List<string>> GetSignedInUsersGroups(TokenValidatedContext context)
          {
              List<string> groupClaims = new List<string>();
              if (HasOverageOccurred(context.Principal))
              {
                  // 
                  groupClaims = GetUserGroupsFromSession(context.HttpContext.Session);
                  if (groupClaims?.Count > 0)
                  {
                      return groupClaims;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                      groupClaims = await ProcessUserGroupsForOverage(context);
                  }
              }
              return groupClaims;
          }
      ```

    GraphHelper.cs contains a method **CheckUsersGroupMembership** that is called in `CustomAuthorization.cs` to check if value of GroupName parameter exists in either Session for Overage scenario or in User claims otherwise.

      ```csharp
        public static bool CheckUsersGroupMembership(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, string GroupName, IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor)
        {
            bool result = false;
            if (HasOverageOccurred(context.User))
            {
                var groups = GetUserGroupsFromSession(_httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Session);
                if (groups?.Count > 0 && groups.Contains(GroupName))
                {
                    result = true;
                }
            }
            else if (context.User.Claims.Any(x => x.Type == "groups" && x.Value == GroupName))
            {
                result = true;
            }
            return result;
        }
      ```

1. In `CustomAuthorization.cs`, we have **GroupPolicyHandler** class that deals with custom Policy-based authorization. It evaluates the GroupPolicyRequirement against AuthorizationHandlerContext by overriding **HandleRequirementAsync** of **AuthorizationHandler**.

    HandleRequirementAsync calls **CheckUsersGroupMembership** method of `GraphHelper.cs` to determine if authorization is allowed.

    ```csharp
        protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context,
                                                   GroupPolicyRequirement requirement)
        {
            if (GraphHelper.CheckUsersGroupMembership(context, requirement.GroupName, _httpContextAccessor))
            {
                context.Succeed(requirement);
            }
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    ```

1. UserProfileController.cs
    1. Checks authorization of signed-in user for ```[Authorize(Policy = "GroupAdmin")]```. If authorized successfully then obtain information from the [/me](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [/me/photo](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/profilephoto-get) endpoints by using `GraphServiceClient`.

1. UserProfile\Index.cshtml
    1. Has some client code that prints the signed-in user's information.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp project. To deploy that to Azure Web Sites, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the project to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of the local environment.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-GroupClaims` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Next, select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.
1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.
1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from **source control**, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-GroupClaims project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page URL, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Azure AD app registration for `WebApp-GroupClaims`

1. Navigate back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application.
1. In the **Authentication** page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will emptied.
In addition, if you increase the instance count of your web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
