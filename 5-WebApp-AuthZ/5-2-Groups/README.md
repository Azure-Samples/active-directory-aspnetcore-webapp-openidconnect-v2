# Add authorization using groups & group claims to an ASP.NET Core Web app that signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample shows how a .NET Core MVC Web app that uses [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code) to sign in users. It also obtains the security groups the signed-in user is assigned to as a claim in their token. Security groups are a popular means to implement authorization.

Authorization in Azure AD can also be done with Application Roles, as shown in [WebApp-RoleClaims](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-1-Roles/README.md). Azure AD Groups and Application Roles are by no means mutually exclusive - they can be used in tandem to provide even finer grained access control.

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)

## Scenario

This sample first leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware to sign in the user. On the home page it displays the various `claims` that the user's [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) contained. The ID token is used by the asp.net security middleware to build the [ClaimsPrincipal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal), accessible via **HttpContext.User**.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

Navigate to the `"5-WebApp-AuthZ"` folder

 ```Sh
  cd "5-2-Groups"
  ```

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start to run the code.

If you don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below.

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the webApp app (WebApp-GroupClaims)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-GroupClaims`.
   - Leave **Supported account types** on the default setting of **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the app's Overview page, select the **Authentication** section.
   - In the Redirect URIs section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs.
       - `https://localhost:44321/`
       - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
       - `https://localhost:44321/Account/EndSession`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires
     the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to
     sign-in the user, and call an API.
1. Select **Save**.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. Select the **API permissions** section
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read**, **Directory.Read.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the web App project

Note: if you had used the automation to setup your application mentioned in [Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-application-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant), the changes below would have been applied by the scripts.

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-GroupClaims` app, in the Azure portal.

### Step 3: Configure your application to receive the **groups** claims

1. In your application settings page on the Application Registration Portal , click on "Manifest" to open the inline manifest editor.
1. Edit the manifest by locating the "groupMembershipClaims" setting, and setting its value to "SecurityGroup".
1. Save the manifest.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "errorUrl": null,
  "groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup",
  ...
}
```

1. To receive the `groups` claim with the object id of the security groups, make sure that the user accounts you plan to sign-in to this app is assigned to a few security groups in this AAD tenant.

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName/mailNickName' instead of Group Ids, check out the [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory (Public Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#configure-the-azure-ad-application-registration-for-group-attributes) feature.

### Step 4: Run the sample

1. Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

1. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. Sign in with a work or school account from the tenant where you created this app.
1. On the home page, the app lists the various claims it obtained from your ID token. You'd notice one more claims named `groups`. If **Overage** occurred, then you'd see a different claim by the name `_claim_names`. The **Overage** scenario is discussed in detail below.
1. On the top menu, click on the signed-in user's name **user@domain.com**, you should now see all kind of information about yourself including your picture. Beneath that, a list of all the security groups that the signed-in user is assigned to are listed as well. All of this was obtained by making calls to Microsoft Graph. This list is useful, if an **Overage** occurs with this signed-in user. The **overage** scenario is discussed later in this article.

### Processing Groups claim in tokens, including handling **overage**

#### The `groups` claim

The object id of the security groups the signed in user is member of is returned in the `groups` claim of the token.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "groups": [
    "0bbe91cc-b69e-414d-85a6-a043d6752215",
    "48931dac-3736-45e7-83e8-015e6dfd6f7c",]
  ...
}
```

#### Groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens**), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the groups claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
    "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
   "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Graph Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
    }
  ...
}
```

> An Identity Office Hours session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and how to handle the overage claim. Watch the video [Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VUPixLSiM)

> You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development.

##### Order of processing the overage claim

1. Check for the claim `_claim_names` with one of the values being `groups`. This indicates overage.

1. If found, make a call to the endpoint specified in `_claim_sources` to fetch user’s groups.

1. If none found, look into the `groups`  claim for user’s groups.

> When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [Directory.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberObjects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-getmemberobjects?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to execute successfully.

- Developers who wish to gain good familiarity of programming for Microsoft Graph are advised to go through the [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A) recorded session.

#### When using the implicit_grant flow to authenticate

In case, you are authenticating using the [implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow), the **overage** indication and limits are different than the apps using other flows.

1. A claim named `hasgroups` with a value of true will be present in the token instead of the `groups` claim .
1. The maximum number of groups provided in the `groups` claim is limited to 6. This is done to prevent  the URI fragment beyond the URL length limits.

### Support in ASP.NET Core middleware libraries

The asp.net middleware supports roles populated from claims by specifying the claim in the `RoleClaimType` property of `TokenValidationParameters`.
Since the `groups` claim contains the object ids of the security groups than actual names, you'd use the group id's instead of group names. See [Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2) for more info.

```CSharp

// Startup.cs
public static IServiceCollection AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, X509Certificate2 tokenDecryptionCertificate = null)
{
        // [removed for] brevity

            // The following lines code instruct the asp.net core middleware to use the data in the "groups" claim in the Authorize attribute and User.IsInrole()
            // See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2 for more info.
            services.Configure<OpenIdConnectOptions>(AzureADDefaults.OpenIdScheme, options =>
            {
                // Use the groups claim for populating roles
                options.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "groups";
            });
        // [removed for] brevity
}

// In code..(Controllers & elsewhere)
[Authorize(Roles = “Group-object-id")] // In controllers
// or
User.IsInRole("Group-object-id"); // In methods

```

## About the code

The following files have the code that would be of interest to you..

1. HomeController.cs
    1. Passes the **HttpContext.User** (the signed-in user) to the view.
1. UserProfileController.cs
    1. Uses the **IMSGraphService** methods to fetch the signed-in user's group memberships.
1 IMSGraphService.cs, MSGraphService.cs and UserGroupsAndDirectoryRoles.cs
    1. Uses the [Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) to carry out various operations with [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com).
1. Home\Index.cshtml
    1. This has some code to print the current user's claims
1. UserProfile\Index.cshtml
    1. Has some client code that prints the signed-in user's information obtained from the [/me](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0), [/me/photo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profilephoto-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [/memberOf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0) endpoints.
1. Startup.cs

     ```CSharp
   - at the top of the file, add the following using directive:

      using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
      ```

   - in the `ConfigureServices` method, replace the two following lines:

     ```CSharp
      services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
              .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));

     // by this line:

     //This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. This endpoint is capable of signing-in users both with their Work and School and Microsoft Personal accounts.
            services.AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(Configuration)
                    .AddMsal(Configuration, new string[] { "User.Read", "Directory.Read.All" }) // Adds support for the MSAL library with the permissions necessary to retrieve the signed-in user's group info in case of a token overage
                    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches(); // Adds aspnetcore MemoryCache as Token cache provider for MSAL.

        services.AddMSGraphService(Configuration);    // Adds the IMSGraphService as an available service for this app.
     ```

1. if you used the Powershell scripts provided in the [AppCreationScripts](.\AppCreationScripts) folder, then note the extra parameter `-GroupMembershipClaims` in the  `Configure.ps1` script.

     ```PowerShell
       -Oauth2AllowImplicitFlow $true `
       -GroupMembershipClaims "SecurityGroup" `
       -PublicClient $False
     ```

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp project. To deploy that to Azure Web Sites, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-GroupClaims` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.
1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.
1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-GroupClaims project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `WebApp-GroupClaims`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `WebApp-GroupClaims` application.
1. In the **Authentication** | page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-GroupClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.
