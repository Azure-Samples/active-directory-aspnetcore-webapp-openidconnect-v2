# Add authorization using **app roles** & **roles** claims to an ASP.NET Core web app thats signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample shows how a .NET Core MVC Web app that uses [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code) to sign in users and use Azure AD Application Roles (app roles) for authorization. App roles, along with Security groups are popular means to implement authorization.

This application implements RBAC using Azure AD's Application Roles & Role Claims feature. Another approach is to use Azure AD Groups and Group Claims, as shown in [WebApp-GroupClaims](../../5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-2-Groups/Readme.md). Azure AD Groups and Application Roles are by no means mutually exclusive; they can be used in tandem to provide even finer grained access control.

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)

Using RBAC with Application Roles and Role Claims, developers can securely enforce authorization policies with minimal effort on their part.

- A Microsoft Identity Platform Office Hours session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and this sample. A recording of the session is is provided in this video [Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VUPixLSiM)

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

## Scenario

This sample first leverages the ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect middleware to sign in the user. On the home page it displays the various `claims` that the user's [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) contained. The ID token is used by the asp.net security middleware to build the [ClaimsPrincipal](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal), accessible via **HttpContext.User** in the code.

This web application allows users to list all users in their tenant or a list of all the roles and groups the signed in user is assigned to depending on the app role they have been assigned to. The idea is to provide an example of how, within an application, access to certain functionality is restricted to subsets of users depending on which role they belong to.

This kind of authorization is implemented using role-based access control (RBAC). When using RBAC, an administrator grants permissions to roles, not to individual users or groups. The administrator can then assign roles to different users and groups to control who has then access to certain content and functionality.  

This sample application defines the following two *Application Roles*:

- `DirectoryViewers`: Have the ability to view any directory user's roles and security group assignments.
- `UserReaders`: Have the ability to view a list of users in the directory.

These application roles are defined in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the application's registration manifest.  When a user signs into the application, Azure AD emits a `roles` claim for each role that the user has been granted individually to the user in the from of role membership.  Assignment of users and groups to roles can be done through the portal's UI, or programmatically using the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) and [Azure AD PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0).  In this sample, application role management is done through the Azure portal or using PowerShell.

NOTE: Role claims will not be present for guest users in a tenant if the `/common` endpoint is used as the authority.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is quiet long, and so are the names of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

### Step 3: Configure your application to receive the **roles** claims

1. To receive the `roles` claim with the name of the app roles this user is assigned to, make sure that the user accounts you plan to sign-in to this app is assigned to the app roles of this app.

#### Step 4: Define your Application Roles

1. In the blade for your  application in Azure Portal, click **Manifest**.
1. Edit the manifest by locating the `appRoles` setting and adding the two Application Roles.  The role definitions are provided in the JSON code block below.  Leave the `allowedMemberTypes` to **User** only.  Each role definition in this manifest must have a different valid **Guid** for the "id" property. Note that the `"value"` property of each role is set to the exact strings **DirectoryViewers** and **UserReaders** (as these strings are used in the code in the application).
1. Save the manifest.

The content of `appRoles` should be the following (the `id` should be a unique Guid)

```JSon
{
  ...
    "appRoles": [
        {
            "allowedMemberTypes": [
                "User"
            ],
            "description": "User readers can read basic profiles of all users in the directory",
            "displayName": "UserReaders",
            "id": "a816142a-2e8e-46c4-9997-f984faccb625",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "lang": null,
            "origin": "Application",
            "value": "UserReaders"
        },
        {
            "allowedMemberTypes": [
                "User"
            ],
            "description": "Directory viewers can view objects in the whole directory.",
            "displayName": "DirectoryViewers",
            "id": "72ff9f52-8011-49e0-a4f4-cc1bb26206fa",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "lang": null,
            "origin": "Application",
            "value": "DirectoryViewers"
        }
    ],
 ...
}
```

1. Follow the steps in the document [Assign users and groups to an application in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/methods-for-assigning-users-and-groups#assign-users) to assign users to these roles.

- You can also use PowerShell scripts that **automatically** creates these two roles for your app. They additionally create two users in your tenant and assign them to these two roles. If you want to use this automation:

  1. In PowerShell run the following command to create the two roles and users.

     ```PowerShell
     .\AppCreationScripts\CreateUsersAndRoles.ps1
     ```

  1. Run the following command to remove the two roles and users once you done testing.

     ```PowerShell
     .\AppCreationScripts\CleanupUsersAndRoles.ps1
     ```

> Remember to make changes in the following line (the app name) in the powershell scripts to ensure that the scripts target the app you intended to use.

 ```PowerShell
      $app = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'WebApp-RolesClaims'"
 ```

   > More details on how to run the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start to run the code.

If you don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below.

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the webApp app (WebApp-RolesClaims)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-RolesClaims`.
   - Leave **Supported account types** on the default setting of **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the app's Overview page, select the **Authentication** section.
   - In the Redirect URIs section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs.
       - `https://localhost:44321/`
       - `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** section set **Logout URL** to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check **ID tokens** as this sample requires
     the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to
     sign-in the user, and call an API.
1. Select **Save**.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. Select the **API permissions** section
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read**, **User.ReadBasic.All**, **Directory.Read.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

> Note:  To receive the `roles` claim with the name of the app roles this user is assigned to, make sure that the user accounts you plan to sign-in to this app is assigned to the app roles of this app. The guide, [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal#assign-a-user-to-an-app---portal) provides step by step instructions.

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the web App project

Note: if you had used the automation to setup your application mentioned in [Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-application-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant), the changes below would have been applied by the scripts.

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-RolesClaims` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-RolesClaims` app, in the Azure portal.

### Step 4: Run the sample

1. Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

1. Open your web browser and make a request to the app. The app immediately attempts to authenticate you via the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. . Sign in using a user account of that tenant. date.

![First time Consent](ReadmeFiles/Sign-in-Consent.png)

1. On the home page, the app lists the various claims it obtained from your [ID token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens). You'd notice a claim named `roles`. There will be one `roles` claim for each app role the signed-in use is assigned to.

1. There also are two links provided on the home page under the **Try one of the following Azure App Role driven operations** heading. These links will result in an access denied error if the signed-in user is not present in the expected role. Sign-out and sign-in with a user account with the correct role assignment to view the contents of these pages.

> Note: You need to be a tenant admin to view the page that lists all the groups and roles the signed-in user is assigned to. It requires the **Directory.Read.All** permission to work. If you run into the **AADSTS65001: The user or administrator has not consented to use the application** error, provide [admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent#grant-admin-consent-when-registering-an-app-in-the-azure-portal) to your app in the portal. Sign-out and sign-in again to make the page work as expected.

When you click on the page that fetches the signed-in user's roles and group assignments, the sample will attempt to obtain consent from you for the **Directory.Read.All** permission using [incremental consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison#incremental-and-dynamic-consent).

### Support in ASP.NET Core middleware libraries

The asp.net middleware supports roles populated from claims by specifying the claim in the `RoleClaimType` property of `TokenValidationParameters`.

```CSharp

// Startup.cs
public static IServiceCollection AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, X509Certificate2 tokenDecryptionCertificate = null)
{
            // [removed for] brevity

            // This is required to be instantiated before the OpenIdConnectOptions starts getting configured.
            // By default, the claims mapping will map claim names in the old format to accommodate older SAML applications.
            // 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role' instead of 'roles'
            // This flag ensures that the ClaimsIdentity claims collection will be built from the claims in the token
            JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims = false;

            // The following lines code instruct the asp.net core middleware to use the data in the "groups" claim in the Authorize attribute and User.IsInrole()
            // See https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2 for more info.
            services.Configure<OpenIdConnectOptions>(AzureADDefaults.OpenIdScheme, options =>
            {
                // Use the groups claim for populating roles
                options.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "roles";
            });
        // [removed for] brevity
}

// In code..(Controllers & elsewhere)
[Authorize(Roles = DirectoryViewers")] // In controllers
// or
User.IsInRole("USerReaders"); // In methods
```

## About the code

1. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs', add the following line:

     ```CSharp
            // This is required to be instantiated before the OpenIdConnectOptions starts getting configured.
            // By default, the claims mapping will map claim names in the old format to accommodate older SAML applications.
            // 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role' instead of 'roles'
            // This flag ensures that the ClaimsIdentity claims collection will be built from the claims in the token
            JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims = false;
     ```

1. In the `HomeController.cs`, the following method is added with the `Authorize` attribute with the name of the app role **UserReaders**, that permits listing of users in the tenant.

    ```CSharp
        [Authorize(Roles = AppRoles.UserReaders )]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Users()
        {
     ```

1. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs', the following line instructs the asp.net security middleware to use the **roles** claim to fetch roles for authorization:

     ```CSharp
                // The claim in the Jwt token where App roles are available.
                options.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "roles";
     ```

1. A new class called `AccountController.cs` is introduced. This contains the code to intercept the default AccessDenied error's route and present the user with an option to sign-out and sign-back in with a different account that has access to the required role.

    ```CSharp
        [AllowAnonymous]
        public IActionResult AccessDenied()
        {
     ```

1. The following method is also added with the `Authorize` attribute with the name of the app role **DirectoryViewers**, that permits listing of roles and groups the signed-in user is assigned to.

    ```CSharp
        [Authorize(Roles = AppRoles.DirectoryViewers)]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Groups()
        {
     ```

1. The views, `Users.cshtml` and `Groups.cshtml` have the code to display the users in a tenant and roles and groups the signed-in user is assigned to respectively.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp project. To deploy it to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, :

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-RolesClaims` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.
1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.
1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-RolesClaims project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `WebApp-RolesClaims`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `WebApp-RolesClaims` application.
1. In the **Authentication** | page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-RolesClaims-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.
